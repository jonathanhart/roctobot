I cannot believe I just made this script public.

This is not an official opensource project. It's a script that has a simple mission: scrape a long list of URLs, extract text, send that to OpenCalais for topic extraction, get the results and pipe them into a graph database, in this case Neo4J.

If someone wants to take on this project further, fork away. But It's 5 years old and likely all the paywall hacks are stale (yes I hacked every paywall in the domains), but still a fun Golang project, but also means it won't run or work. I just had to put it public.
